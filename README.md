# aeternity_supply_chain_tokenisation
Aeternity blockchain allows supply chain managements to be much more flexible, transparent and secure without affecting the fundamental process.
NFT tokens are not instantly swapable one to one.so here is example of aeternity NFT tokenization for supply chain management.
** Development IDE : **
-Develop your own local environment setup with the local development framework AEproject.
-use the link here -( https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-aeproject-js )
** Online IDE : **
-use the online framework development for reference use this -( https://contracts.aepps.com/)
** Implementation: **
-Now, we will compile the aeternity smart contract by using name , symbol and owner address of the nonFungible token. 
-Upon deployment, the token sets its owner - the Call.caller (deployer). The owner has   the ability to create (mint) new tokens or products.
-When token is created it is associated with a user - the tokenOwner.-
-After compilation and deployment we can see deployed contract address and call function  and call static function.
-On the local host( https://testnet.aeternal.io/ ) we can see the  balance of the account address and all the transaction that is happened on contract address.
-Using contract address we can search tha all the blocks , transactions, balance on blockchain.
